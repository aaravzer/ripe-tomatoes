# ripe-tomatoes üçÖ  (WIP)
This web application, provided with a movie description, queries a text classification model( trained on rotten tomatoes movie descriptions)  and concludes a positive or negative label  for that description. I made this in a quick 30 minutes not counting the time it took for google colab to train the model.
